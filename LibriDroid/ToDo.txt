Dickens book without RSS feed... Wreck of the golden mary...

communication through handler instead of DB...
  need unique generated ID, and a map to hold messages in queue
  
play/pause on app's activities (show small simple progress?)

abstract player controller into widget

Ugh... even the player thread could have a race condition 
 eg) on the waiting for buffering
 and maybe other

BookViewActivity
  deregister query listeners on hide. 

display the download rate on downloads page.. (and notification..?)
display time/duration on notification?

show readers of each section/book
status of download requests (to handle errors..) 

when downloading, if hit end of file, "pause" and show wait cycle (notification if no player)
   continue (and remove notification or wait cycle)

handle deletes while service is playing...

delete all files in another thread

view "orphaned" audio files in libridroid directory (books not in library, but files/directory still exist)

hook into phone's main search...?
player store state of buffered progress.. Or get immediately updated from player?

only one of each activity on stack... pressing back goes through all of them
  
bookmarks


optimize findViewById- cache objects in ivars   

                               
Done:
When player paused, still allow update of position while pressing forward/back
Fix download pause/resume button
  (threading problem- look to player for example of fix)
Pressing play while playing... causes to start again?!



My book icon
downloads icon
download activity
   button not updating correctly
     link better with the service's actions (e.g., look at player) 
player icon
     give option to delete sections (one-by-one or whole book's)
     why is update buffering "pausing" sometimes
     update buffering while paused..?
     change pause/play label when externally paused (e.g., audio focus helper)
