When buffering file while playing, make sure it is downloading- start if necessary
on "early completion", when file still needs downloading, put the buffering in new thread
fix up fraction calculation while buffering (use section's size, not the player's duration)
fix up the downloading service to wait till previous one finishes, to avoid probable race condition on the notification
